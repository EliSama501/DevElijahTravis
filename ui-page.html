      <p class="p-ux">
        The Website consist of a linear gradient background to give a fullness
        to the homepage, and the overall design of the website when traveling
        through the navigation/pages. To make everything on the homepage pop I
        gave it a Subtle border, blur, or halo around the imagery to give it
        that floating effect you see. the same goes for the button, even though
        we know most user understand what’s clickable and not we as developers
        and designer still understand we must help user navigate through the
        website or application.

      <img src="ui-imgs/art-img.png" alt="" class="intro-ui" />
      <p class="p-ux">
        The artboard was created to help me understand how I wanted to layer out
        things through my mockups to bring to life in the website and
        application. To me, as a designer a artboard is just as important as the
        color scheme, which is why I added the color scheme to the artboard to
        show the contrast of importance, and how well each color balances off
        each other, and that I understand how eyes view colors on portable-media
        and how it should always be soft and not harsh

        Cost-Free is about buying medicine at the lowest price valuable on the
        market, which is near cost, giving the name Cost-Free. When ordering
        medicine you’ll be greeted with the about, dosages, cost, and a add to
        cart button, and as you scroll you see more. Bigger is better, easier to
        see and click. So I made the quantity images you can click, and the
        image changes color as well as it convert to your cart at the same time.
        To remove just clock the image again making it easier for people of all
        ages. The Interface of a website or application shouldn’t just be
        pretty, but easy to navigate as well.
